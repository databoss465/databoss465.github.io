## Introduction

Hey, everyone! This is the first post of what I hope will be a math blog!

I think I'll post about *LEAN4*, proof writing, interesting problems, etc...
Maybe, I'll post a bit about my Grad School applications, when that time coems around.

Stick around for cool math stuff and subscribe!
