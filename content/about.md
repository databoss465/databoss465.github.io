## Who's this guy?

I am Dattabhasvant Ghadiyaram (/dət̪t̪ɐbʱɑːs̪ʋənt̪ ɡʱəɖiːɑːrəm/). I am from Bangalore, India. I am doing my Bachelors of Science at IISc Bangalore, with a major in Mathematics. My primary interests are Math-AI, automated theorem proving, formal mathematics, complex analysis and proabability theory.

## What does he do?

I spend most of my time doing math (obviously). I recently started competetive programming, check out my [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/databoss645) page. In my leisure time I read, I hit the gym or I go running. Sometimes I play video games too! I'm also passionate about languages, I speak 4 languages quite fluently, and I can converse with some effort in a few more.
